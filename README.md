# Change-Music-Titles
After translating a track list from the back of your CD, you can apply this to your ripped music.

Steps:
1. Translate your music such that each song title is prefixed with its track number and a full stop. //The patterns are made to work with English words iirc. Mileage may vary when translating from the Latin alphabet into other character sets.
2. Run `Parse from printed list.py` with the 'raw' data as the input.

   — This generates an ordered list.
4. Move `Change titles.py` to the directory with the music
5. Run `Change titles.py` with the file generated by `Parse from printed list.py` as the input
6. Input the path to the music files when prompted with `Music files are in `

   — If the music files and `Change titles.py` are in the same directory, press enter.
7. Wait for the script to finish
